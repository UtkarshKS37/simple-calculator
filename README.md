# simple-calculator
This project is a lightweight, beginner-friendly web application that demonstrates how to build a functional calculator interface and logic using vanilla web technologies. It’s ideal for learning and practicing DOM operations, event handling and basic arithmetic logic in JavaScript.

Features:
1. Simple, clean interface for calculator operations
2. Supports input of numbers and operators (+, -, ×, ÷)
3. Clear (“AC”) and delete (“DEL”) functionality
4. Responsive layout so it works well on different screen sizes
5. No external libraries/frameworks — just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Technologies Used:
HTML5 – to build the structure of the calculator interface
CSS3 – to style the calculator layout, buttons and responsive behaviour
JavaScript (ES6+) – to handle user input, perform calculations and update the UI
